# WebXR Fingerprint
A repository for fingerprinting using the WebXR API

## Webserver setup
Make sure you have node installed. I recommend using [NVS](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs)

To develop dynamically, use the following to watch your files for updates locally:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run watch
```
